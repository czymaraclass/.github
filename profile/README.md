# Quantitative Data Analysis for Social Scientists: An Open-Access Course Collection

[Czymara Courses](https://github.com/czymaraclass) is an open-access collection dedicated to quantitative data analysis. These courses cover a range of skills, from [foundational programming](https://github.com/czymaraclass/intros) to advanced techniques in [computational social science](https://github.com/czymaraclass/CSS_WS24), [panel data analysis](https://github.com/czymaraclass/LongDataAnalysis) (currently offline), and [multilevel modeling](https://github.com/czymaraclass/CompSocResearch). Each course includes practical exercises and real-world examples, providing a comprehensive toolkit for conducting robust social science research. Accessible and hands-on, these resources are designed to support both beginners and advanced learners in developing data-driven insights and enhancing their analytical capabilities in social research.

## About the Lecturer

I specialize in teaching courses focused on quantitative methods and research design for social science students. My teaching experience spans several years and includes work at multiple institutions like Goethe University Frankfurt and the University of Cologne, as well as various educational formats, including summer schools such as the DeZIM Summer School, the Frankfurt Summer School, and the Workshops for Ukraine series.
